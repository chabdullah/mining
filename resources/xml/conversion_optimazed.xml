In Japan, seasonal allergic rhinitis in the spring due to exposure to Japanese cedar or Japanese cypress pollen is common. However,

the allergic profile for perennial allergens in spring pollinosis remains unclear. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the allergic

profiles of 652 patients with rhinitis. Total serum IgE, serum-specific IgE, and blood eosinophil counts were measured. Allergic

sensitization, determined by the serum allergen-specific IgE level, did not always correspond with the patient‚Äôs symptoms. Only

27% of patients with allergic symptoms in response to spring pollens were sensitized to these allergens alone; 31% of patients were

also sensitized to perennial allergens, even without symptoms due to perennial allergens. Total serum IgE and eosinophil cell counts

were significantly elevated in patients sensitized to perennial allergens and spring pollens, as compared to patients sensitized only

to spring pollens. Most children sensitized to spring pollen (84%) were sensitized to perennial allergens, at a higher rate than

adults (49%). Patients sensitized to spring pollens are likely to be latently sensitized to perennial allergens. This is especially true

for children and should be monitored closely. Improvement in seasonal allergic conditions, including latent perennial allergy, is

important to prevent symptoms that could advance to asthma.

Seasonal allergic rhinitis caused by either Japanese cedar or

Japanese cypress pollen is common in Japan. And Japanese

cedar pollinosis is the most prevalent allergy in Japan [1].

In 2003, the prevalence of Japanese cedar pollinosis was

reported to be 19.4% [2]. Such patients often complain that

their symptoms occur only during the spring. However,

patients may be sensitized to other allergens as well, despite

being asymptomatic. Allergy is a systemic disorder that can

affect the respiratory tract, eyes, skin, and gastrointestinal

tract [3] and can cause asthma as well as allergic rhini-

tis. Perennial allergens such as mites, fungal spores, and

domestic animals are considered important risk factors for

the development of other allergic disorders such as asthma

[4]. To control allergic diseases and prevent allergic rhinitis

from progressing to other allergic disorders, it is important

for patients to know their allergic profile, that is, the type

and seriousness of their allergy. Therefore, we investigated

the allergic profiles and sensitization to other allergens in

patients sensitized to either Japanese cedar or Japanese

cypress pollens.

2. Materials and Methods

This study was conducted on 652 consecutive outpatients

(284 males, 368 females) with rhinitis, from January 2004 to

March 2005. Patients enrolled were aged 2‚Äì87 years (median

age, 44 years) and consisted of 544 adults above 18 years of

age (225 men and 319 women; age range, 18‚Äì87 years) and

108 children below 18 years of age (59 boys and 49 girls;

age range, 2‚Äì17 years). Patients with acute rhinosinusitis,

common cold, and flu were excluded from the study. None

of the patients had been treated previously with any specific

immunotherapy. In addition to the standard otorhinolaryn-

gological examination, we measured total serum IgE, serum-

specific IgE levels (Cap-RAST (Radioallergosorbent test),

Bio Medical Laboratories, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), and blood

eosinophil counts. These serum tests were done at the

time when rhinitis symptoms appeared. Serum-specific IgE

was measured for the following allergens: Japanese cedar

(Cryptomeria japonica), Japanese cypress (Chamaecyparis

obtusa), grass (Dactylis glomerata, Phleum pratense, and

Ambrosia artemisiifolia), cat dandruff, dog dandruff, molds

(Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus, and Candida), and mites

(Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and Dermatophagoides fari-

nae). In Japan, pollens of Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress

are released mainly in spring [1]. In contrast, pollens of

Dactylis glomerata and Phleum pretense peak in summer,

and pollen of Ambrosia artemisiifolia is most prevalent in

fall. These allergens were classified into three types: spring

pollens, summer/fall pollens, and perennial allergens. Spring

pollens included Japanese cedar and Japanese cypress. The

summer/fall pollen examined was grass. Perennial allergens

were cat and dog dandruff, A. alternata, Aspergillus, Candida,

and mites. The cutoff value for serum-specific IgE levels

was defined as 0.35 kUA/L. The diagnosis of Japanese cedar

or Japanese cypress pollinosis is done by otorhinolaryn-

gologist according to clinical history, nasal findings, and

serum-specific IgE levels. Patients, whose serum-specific IgE

levels were more than 0.35 kUA/L, were defined as having

sensitization to specific allergens. Asthma is diagnosed by

pulmonologists or pediatricians, according to clinical history

and physical findings suggesting recurrent episodes of airflow

obstruction, and spirometry to demonstrate obstruction and

assess reversibility.

3. Results

3.1. Sensitization in Patients Symptomatic Only to Japanese

Cedar and/or Japanese Cypress. One hundred and thirty-five

patients had allergic symptoms in response to only spring

allergens, that is, Japanese cedar and/or Japanese cypress.

Only 27% (36/135) of these patients showed allergic sensi-

tization exclusively to these allergens, while 34% (46/135)

of patients were also sensitized to perennial allergens (31%,

42/135) or summer/fall allergens (3%, 4/135) without allergic

symptoms. In addition, 32% (43/135) of patients showed

no sensitization to any allergen, despite the presence of

allergic symptoms. Of the total, 7% (10/135) of patients were

not sensitized to cedar and/or cypress pollen, but only to

3.2. Allergic Sensitization in Adults and Children. Three

hundred and twenty-nine (50%) of the 652 patients showed

allergic sensitization in our study. One hundred and twenty-

three of these patients were sensitized only to seasonal

allergens (spring (18%, 115/652) or summer/fall pollen (4%,

26/652)), while 21% (137/652) of patients were sensitized to

both spring pollens and perennial allergens (Table 1). Ten

percent of patients (68/652) were sensitized to perennial

allergens but not to spring pollens.

Two hundred and sixteen (40%) of 544 adult patients

were sensitized to spring pollens. One hundred and six (49%)

of 216 adults were sensitized to perennial allergens as well as

spring pollens, while 43% (93/216) of adult patients showed

sensitization only to spring pollens, and 8% (17/216) did

only to spring and summer/fall pollen. Thirty-seven (34%)

of 108 children were sensitized to spring pollens. However,

only 5 of 37 children (14%) were sensitized only to spring

pollens. Hence, most children (84%; 31/37) sensitized to

spring pollens were also sensitized to perennial allergens.

Children were significantly more likely than adults to be

sensitized to perennial allergens in addition to spring pollens

(ùëÉ = 0.0001, chi-square test). The rate of sensitization to

spring pollens gradually increased with the patient‚Äôs age and

peaked in the early 20s (Figure 1) and then fell gradually with

age after that. A similar tendency was shown in perennial

allergens (mites) although the rate of sensitization peaked at

ages 15‚Äì17, unlike with spring pollens. In children aged 15‚Äì

17, the rate of sensitization to perennial allergens (mites) was

higher than it was to spring allergens. After patients reached

their 20s, the rate of sensitization to spring pollens was higher

than perennial allergens (mites).

spring pollen and 609 ¬± 104 IU/mL in the 137 patients sensi-

tized to both perennial allergens and spring pollens (Table 2).

Mean total serum IgE level was significantly elevated in

4. Discussion

Allergic sensitization, as diagnosed by the serum allergen-

specific IgE level, does not always correspond with the

patient‚Äôs symptoms. We found that approximately twice as

many patients were sensitized to both spring pollens and

perennial allergens compared to patients sensitized only to

spring pollens. However, many patients were asymptomatic

to perennial allergens. Exposure to perennial allergens, such

as house dust mite and cat and dog dandruff, is an important

predisposing risk factor for asthma [4]. Previous diagnosis

of asthma was largely related to serum IgE levels and blood

eosinophil counts [5‚Äì7]. Even in nonasthmatic patients,

airway responsiveness (assessed using methacholine [8]) is

increased in some cases of allergic rhinitis, indicating an

increased risk for asthma [9‚Äì11]. Sensitization to cat dandruff,

dust mite, cockroach, and ragweed is an important predictor

of airway hyperresponsiveness [12]. Airway hyperresponsive-

ness is strongly related to elevated total serum IgE levels,

even in asymptomatic patients [5, 13]. In other words, total

serum IgE level is considered an indicator of probable airway

hyperresponsiveness or asthma. In our study, total serum

IgE levels and blood cell eosinophil counts were significantly

elevated in patients sensitized to both spring pollens and

perennial allergens, as compared to patients sensitized only

to spring pollens. Therefore, patients sensitized to both spring

pollens and perennial allergens might be at greater risk of

developing airway hyperresponsiveness or asthma.

perennial allergen sensitization as well as spring pollen

sensitization if exposed previously, whereas for adults, the

proportion was approximately 50%. Early childhood is a criti-

cal factor for determining whether a child will be predisposed

to asthma later in life [4, 13, 14]. Sensitization to perennial

allergens early in life can lead to chronic asthma, charac-

terized by airway hyperresponsiveness and impairment of

lung function [14, 15]. In addition, exposure to high levels of

perennial allergens aggravates this process, while sensitiza-

tion to seasonal allergens has not been shown to be important

[14]. Therefore, patients with allergic rhinitis caused by spring

pollen include those at high risk for developing asthma,

since approximately two-thirds of individuals are concomi-

tantly sensitized to perennial allergens without symptoms.

Uncontrolled allergic rhinitis may cause the condition of

patients with coexisting asthma to deteriorate [16]. On the

other hand, seasonal allergens may affect asthma to some

degree, considering that patients with hay fever demonstrate

airway hyperresponsiveness during pollen season [10]. In

addition, disease control by pollen immunotherapy could

help prevent the development of asthma in children with sea-

sonal allergic rhinitis [17]. Improvement in seasonal allergic

conditions, including covert perennial allergy, is important

for preventing the progression of allergic rhinitis to asthma.

In particular, children with seasonal allergic rhinitis should

avoid exposure to perennial allergens as well as spring pollens

to prevent them from developing asthma. As we found in this

study, the majority of children with seasonal allergic rhinitis

are also sensitized to perennial allergens. Even children

who are not allergic may benefit from minimal exposure to

perennial allergens to prevent sensitization. Improvement of

allergic conditions is considered important to prevent airway

hyperresponsiveness and the development of asthma.

5. Conclusion

Patients who have been sensitized to spring pollen are also

likely to have been covertly sensitized to perennial allergens.

This is especially true for children. Improvement in the sea-
